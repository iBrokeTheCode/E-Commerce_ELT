    This project analyzes e-commerce data from a Brazilian marketplace to explore key business metrics related to **revenue** and **delivery performance**. Using an interactive Marimo application, the analysis provides insights into:

    * **Revenue:** Annual revenue, popular product categories, and sales by state.
    * **Delivery:** Delivery performance, including time-to-delivery and its correlation with public holidays.

    The data pipeline processes information from multiple CSV files and a public API, storing and analyzing the results using Python. The final interactive report is presented as a Hugging Face Space built with Marimo.
