## 1. üõçÔ∏è Description

This project analyzes e-commerce data from a Brazilian marketplace to explore key business metrics related to **revenue** and **delivery performance**. Using an interactive Marimo application, the analysis provides insights into:

- **Revenue:** Annual revenue, popular product categories, and sales by state.
- **Delivery:** Delivery performance, including time-to-delivery and its correlation with public holidays.

The data pipeline processes information from [multiple CSV files](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and a [public API](https://date.nager.at/Api), storing and analyzing the results using Python. The final interactive report is presented as a Hugging Face Space built with Marimo.
